# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="50px"> My name is Abisoye 

As a software engineer, I love to create user interfaces and web applications that scale and perform well on all devices. I use technologies such as JS/TS, Vue/Nuxt, React/Next, and Python to deliver solutions that meet the needs of clients and users across various industries and domains.

I am also passionate about immersive technologies, such as AR and VR, and how they can enhance the user experience and understanding of products. I have completed multiple courses and certifications on Google ARCore, SparkAR, Lens Studio, Unreal Engine, and C++, and I have built and deployed several AR filters and experiences for social media platforms. I have a master's degree in computer science from Liverpool John Moores University, where I learned more about the theory and practice of computer graphics, vision, and animation.
